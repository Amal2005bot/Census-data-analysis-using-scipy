# Migration & Demographic Analysis using Python

Performed statistical analysis on U.S. migration and demographic data using independent two-sample t-tests to evaluate differences across states, regions, and population groups.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and aggregation using Pandas
- Statistical hypothesis testing with SciPy
- Exploratory demographic data analysis
- Interpreting p-values and statistical significance

## Analysis Highlights
- Compared within-state vs between-state migration for California and New York
- Analyzed citizenship status (Native, Naturalized, Non-Citizens)
- Evaluated education level differences across U.S. regions
- Studied marital status variations across divisions

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy

## Outcome
All comparisons showed no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05), demonstrating correct application of statistical testing and data interpretation.
